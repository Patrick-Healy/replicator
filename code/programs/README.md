# Programs

Store reusable helper functions and subroutines in this folder. These are scripts called by your main analysis scripts, not executed directly by the master script (`run.do` or `run.R`).

Examples:
- Custom estimation routines
- Data cleaning functions
- Formatting utilities
- Project-specific ado-files (Stata)

Keeping programs separate from main scripts reduces clutter in larger projects.
