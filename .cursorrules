# Cursor Rules for replication-compliance

This repository contains an Agent Skill for DCAS compliance auditing.

## Skill Location

The main skill is at `.github/skills/replication-compliance/SKILL.md`

## When to Use

When the user asks about:
- DCAS compliance
- Replication packages
- AEA/journal submission readiness
- Research reproducibility audits

## How to Use

1. Read `.github/skills/replication-compliance/SKILL.md`
2. Follow the audit workflow in that file
3. Reference `references/DCAS_RULES.md` for rule details
4. Reference `references/LANGUAGE_GUIDES.md` for Stata/R/Python/MATLAB/Julia checks

## Safety Rules

- Read files but do not run analysis code unless asked
- Never execute: `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `git rebase`
- Flag dangerous commands for manual user execution
